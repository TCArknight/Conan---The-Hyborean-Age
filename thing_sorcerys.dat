  <thing id="sorAlchemy" name="Alchemy" description="Any academic or fool can mix substances and call themselves an alchemist; in fact, many do. But to truly understand alchemy is to venture into the magical nature of this ancient art. Alchemy is the magic of creation and control, from creation of food and light to the manipulation of physical materials—creating armor from nothing and animating statues to act as stalwart guardians. Alchemy is a misunderstood art that provides a trained sorcerer with essential skills for both survival and prosperity in the Hyborian Age." compset="Sorcery">

  <thing id="sorBlackMagic" name="Black Magic" description="Black Magic involves the manipulation of darkness, control of the mind, and the weaponization of fear. Many adept sorcerers have fallen prey to the lure of the dark arts, becoming lost in a constant search for the distant voice on the breeze or the whisper deep in the darkness below, only to lose their minds to magic more powerful than their comprehension. For those who master these abilities, unimaginable power is possible, but at what cost? Only the darkness can truly know." compset="Sorcery"></thing>
  <thing id="sorDemonMagic" name="Demonic Magic" description="Beyond our own, other realms exist: realms bathed in blood and fire, that dance to a cacophony of screams. The demons that live within these realms sometimes break through to our own, or sometimes they are called forth, summoned by powerful sorcerers looking to invoke their powers. Demonic Magic is the study of these otherworldly beasts and the learning associated with summoning their malignant forms or harnessing their arcane devilry." compset="Sorcery"></thing>
  <thing id="sorNecroMagic" name="Necromantic Magic" description="The dead are never truly dead. Those who live in the Hyborian Age know too well of the waking dead: of skeleton warriors, feral ghouls, and sinister hauntings. Those who study such magic are often called Necromancer or Death Caller, but the art of Necromantic Magic is so much more than the cultist-driven doctrine it is so often associated with. To  know the secrets of the ancient discipline is to play with life, to ally with those who have fallen before you and speak to a person’s very soul." compset="Sorcery"></thing>
  <thing id="sorWhiteMagic" name="White Magic" description="Life comes in many forms. From those who walk the wilderness to the ancient trees in the continent’s densest woodlands. From the smallest creature on the desert floor to the weather thundering high above. Sorcerers who embrace these energies may learn to understand the feelings of those around them, to sense magical potential in others, and to speak to the many beasts that roam the world. White Magic is the study of life, healing, and nature, combined with a deep understanding of all aspects of sorcery." compset="Sorcery"></thing>
